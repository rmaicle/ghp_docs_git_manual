Git Manual 2.12.2

The git manual documentation files can be converted from asciidoc to markdown by running the script files in the subdirectories.
They are not consolidated yet for testing purposes.

Copy the files from the git documentation folder /Documentation to the root directory of this repository as

    _source-<version>
    
and in this case it is `_source-2.12.2`.

The script variable pointing to the git documentation directory must be updated when a new version is used.
This will be applicable only for the meantime until after testing the scripts.

    source="../../_source-2.12.2"
    
The script files:

* ch2/sec1/subsection_1
* ch2/sec1/subsection_2
* ch2/sec1/subsection_3
* ch2/sec2/subsection_1
* ch2/sec2/subsection_2
* ch2/sec2/subsection_3
* ch2/sec2/subsection_4
